# Round 1 Log

**Start date**: 03/08/20

**End date**: 06/16/20

## Goals

- Rewrite all my old code using ReactJS as the framework.

## Day 1

- Project you are working on (including link)

  - [Lottery Game 2.0](https://github.com/Bobj2018/Lottery-Game-2.0)

- Progress today
  - Today, I setup my project structure for the Lottery Game. It is using Redux to manage the global state.
- Challenges you faced
  - I had difficulty setting up redux but, I was able to fix it by installing the right packages.
- Tasks for tomorrow
  - Create the random number generator

## Day 2

- Project you are working on (including link)

  - [Lottery Game 2.0](https://github.com/Bobj2018/Lottery-Game-2.0)

- Progress today
  - Ok, I said I would do the generator but, it slipped my mind. I worked on the user input field and prepared for when the user selects the number of inputs
- Challenges you faced
  - I am having issue mapping the number of inputs to an array in the state. I might have to rework on how it is implemented.
- Tasks for tomorrow
  - Work on the Number Generator

## Day 3

- Project you are working on (including link)

  - [Lottery Game 2.0](https://github.com/Bobj2018/Lottery-Game-2.0)

- Progress today
  - Work on the random generator with great success. The array is generated after the app is rendered and the user can generate new number if they want.
- Challenges you faced
  - None
- Tasks for tomorrow
  - Work on User Component
